# Our Origin Story

Our journey began when Dr. Yasir Latif and I met in 2022 while working on event-camera-based star tracker platforms at the Australian Institute of Machine Learning, University of Adelaide. Our research focused on designing algorithms for fine-pointing to mitigate satellite jitter. - https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12588

We believe very soon every satellite will sense and report their situational awareness so that other satellites can use! This requires, fast sensing in space, distributed ledger and propulsion systems. Today, all three pieces of tech have matured to make this a reality!
While observing satellites and space debris, we recognized the critical need for immutable ledgers to prevent the weaponization of space objects. This led us to collaborate with Dr. Moriba Jah (Steve Wozniak’s co-founder at Privateer Space) in March 2024.
